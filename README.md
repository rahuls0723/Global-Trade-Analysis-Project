# 🌍 Global Trade Analysis

  This project focuses on analyzing **global trade and logistics** to identify key trends in **commodities, trade values, and quantities** across **USA, Canada, and Australia**. The analysis was performed using **R, Excel, and Power BI** to provide **clean, structured data** and generate **actionable insights** for decision-making.  
 
  The client wanted to launch a new business unit, focusing on global trade and logistics, majorly in the countries such as USA, Canada and Australia  The dataset provided by the client contained 59090 observations of 10 variables.  The client insisted the data to be cleaned using Excel or R. The Dataset contained missing values and was cleaned using the R programming language.  Power Bi dashboards were created from the cleaned dataset.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools Used  
-  **R Programming** – Data cleaning, missing value handling, trade balance calculations  
-  **Excel** – Data validation, structuring, and exploratory analysis  
-  **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards for visualizing trade trends  

## 🎯 Key Achievements
